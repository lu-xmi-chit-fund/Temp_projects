Broadcasts
The term itself means sending data/signals to all users which are in the network.
In context of android it means sending the data(broadcast message) to the subscribed receivers receivers.
Usually the receivers and senders can be both Android System and Android Apps.
Example of System Sending Broadcasts:
Booting Up
Screen Off/On
USB Attached/Detached

Broadcasts Messages are sent using Intent, usually the structure of an intent object is as follows:
Intent Object
->action //android.intent.action.AIRPLANE_MODE
->data //boolean True/False

Changes to system broadcasts:
From android 7 onwards following changes have occured:

Android 7

Android 7.0 (API level 24) and higher don't send the following system broadcasts:
ACTION_NEW_PICTURE //A new picture is taken by the camera, and the entry of the picture has been added to the media store. 
ACTION_NEW_VIDEO //A new video is recorded by the camera, and the entry of the video has been added to the media store. 
CONNECTIVITY_ACTION
Apps targeting Android 7.0 (API level 24) and higher do not receive this broadcast if they declare the broadcast receiver in their manifest. Apps will still receive broadcasts
 if they register their BroadcastReceiver with Context.registerReceiver() and that context is still valid.


Android 8.0
If your app targets Android 8.0 or higher, you cannot use the manifest to declare a receiver for most implicit broadcasts (broadcasts that don't target your app specifically). You can still use a context-registered receiver when the user is actively using your app.


Android 9
Beginning with Android 9 (API level 28), The NETWORK_STATE_CHANGED_ACTION broadcast doesn't receive information about the user's location or personally identifiable data.
In addition, if your app is installed on a device running Android 9 or higher, system broadcasts from Wi-Fi don't contain SSIDs, BSSIDs, connection information, or scan results. To get this information, call getConnectionInfo() instead.


Receiving broadcasts
Apps can receive broadcasts in two ways:
 1. Through manifest-declared receivers 
 2. Through context-registered receivers.
